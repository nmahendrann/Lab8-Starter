## Q1
Graceful degredation is a design philosophy that allows functionality of a website that would work on a high end model to also exist for extremely low end devices. In other words, it has features that work best on the highest quality devices, but also supports devices with none of those features. Service workers are representatitive of graceful degredation, as they allow users with slow or even no network connection to use a website by serving pre cached responses to requests. This is graceful degredation as although a website is designed to work with a stable network connection, they can still provide the nesessary content with suboptimal conditions.
